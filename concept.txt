A player will cast their move by specifying a number, there are three possible outcomes:
- Invalid entry: 	out of range
- Invalid entry: 	space already taken
- Valid entry: 	player "token" is placed

At the end of each turn a "victory condition" will be evaluated.  If a player owns the following combinations, they will be crowned victorious:
- 7 4 3
- 8 5 2
- 9 6 1
- 7 8 9
- 4 5 6
- 3 2 1 
- 7 5 1
- 3 5 9

If all positions are occupied and no player has a victory, it will be considered a draw.
